# Projects of Time Series

In this part, I will talk about different topics associated with time series in Python, the goal of how to use different techniques depending on the behavior or phenomenon under study is presented.

* First project: it's ARIMA models with BTC-USD only 5 days! But you may ask me, what are ARIMA models? What are they talking about? Regarding biography, an ARIMA model is a parametric model for non-stationary stochastic time series, where from the acronym AR, its meaning is autoregressive, in this particular case, it is when the time series has variance non-stationary, while MA is your mean moving average, it is generally when the time series is a non-stationary average, and it needs a of transformation, in other words, I applied this model on the BTC-USD series, the objective is Forecast for only 5 days.

There are several possible projects with cryptos, later maybe I will do other models extended with ARIMA or possible types of models.

* coming soon other projects!
