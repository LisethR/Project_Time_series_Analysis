# Projects of Time Series

In this part I will talk about of different topic associate with Time Series in Python

* First project - That is ARIMA models with BTC-USD only 5 days! But you maybe ask me What are ARIMA models? What do you talk about?, respect of the biography a ARIMA models is a parametric model for stochastic nonstationary time series, where of acronym AR, Its mean autoregressive, in this particular case, is when of time series has nonstationary variance, while MA its mean moving average, generally is when of time series is nonstationary average, and you need a bit transformation.


* coming soon other projects!
